	<h1>Rohan Mehta</h1>
	<p>I am a postdoctoral researched in the lab of <a href="http://weissmanlab.github.io/"> Daniel Weissman </a> at Emory University. 
		Previously I obtained my PhD from Stanford University, under <a href="https://rosenberglab.stanford.edu/"> Noah Rosenberg </a>, 
		and my BS in Biology and in Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with <a href="https://www-biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/lchao"> Lin Chao <a>,
		<a href="https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/kurle/"> Carolyn Kurle </a>, and <a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/jshurin"> Jonathan Shurin</a>.	
		I study evolutionary theory and population genetics. My primary research interests are:
		<ul>
			<li> Effects of evolutionary processes on the shapes of gene genealogies [<a href="pubs/#pub2">2</a>, <a href="pubs/#pub1">1</a>] </li>
			<li> Evolution of complex interactions between individuals and other individuals or between individuals and the environment </li>
			<li> Properties of mathematical quantities used in the study of evolving populations [<a href="pubs/#pub4">4</a>] </li>
			<li> General rules that describe evolutionary dynamics </li>
		</ul>
		Other topics I have worked on include:
		<ul>
			<li> Foraging theory [<a href="pubs/#pub3">3</a>]</li>
		</ul>
